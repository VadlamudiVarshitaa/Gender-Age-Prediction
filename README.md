Gender-Age-Prediction This project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to predict the gender and age of individuals from photos. Using Python and OpenCV, the project addresses challenges such as varying lighting conditions and the use of cosmetics. The model is trained to accurately analyze facial features and provide age and gender predictions, making it a useful tool in various applications like social media, security, and customer analytics.

# How to Use the Code
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the cloned repository.
- Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using.
- Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
- For data preprocessing
- For training models
- Follow the instructions in the preprocessing.ipynb notebook to load and preprocess the dataset. Then, use the train_models.ipynb notebook to train and evaluate the gender and age prediction models.

# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Preparing the dataset by detecting and aligning faces using OpenCV.
- Feature Extraction: Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract relevant features from facial images.
- Model Building: Implementing machine learning models to predict age and gender based on extracted features.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE) for age prediction, and confusion matrix for gender classification.
- Real-time Prediction: Applying the model to real-time video streams or individual photos for age and gender prediction.
